# Topic Models: A Practical Introduction in Python
## A workshop with the [Massive Data Institute](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/research/the-massive-data-institute/), Georgetown University

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jhaber-zz/topic-models-2022/HEAD))


## Overview

Topic models are among the most popular techniques in natural language processing (NLP), a versatile tool for understanding the latent themes in text that has been widely applied to websites, books, school applications, social media, and everything else. Topic models analyze word co-occurrences within and across documents to discover the topics that generated them, the topics’ component words, and their distribution over a corpus. This workshop will give you hands-on experience with a typical topic modeling workflow, including text preprocessing and model construction and evaluation. Basic familiarity with Python is required; prior experience with NLP is useful but not required.


## Workshop goals

* TBD


## Prerequisites

We will get our hands dirty implementing topic modeling at a fairly basic level. To follow along with the code—which is the point—will need some familiarity with Python and Jupyter Notebooks. If you haven't programmed in Python or haven’t used Jupyter Notebooks, please do some self-teaching before this workshop using resources like those listed below. 


## Getting started & software prerequisites

For simplicity, just click the "Launch Binder" button to create a virtual environment ready for this workshop. 

If you want to run the code on your computer, you have two options. You could use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/) to make installation easy: [download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) . Or if you already have Python 3.x installed with the full list of libraries listed under `requirements.txt`, you're welcome to clone this repository and follow along on your own machine. You can also install all the necessary packages like so: 

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

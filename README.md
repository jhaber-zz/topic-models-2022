# topic-models-2022
Topic models are among the most popular techniques in natural language processing (NLP), a versatile tool for understanding the latent themes in text that has been widely applied to websites, books, school applications, social media, and everything else. Topic models analyze word co-occurrences within and across documents to discover the topics that generated them, the topicsâ€™ component words, and their distribution over a corpus. This workshop will give you hands-on experience with a typical topic modeling workflow, including text preprocessing and model construction and evaluation. Basic familiarity with Python is required; prior experience with NLP is useful but not required.
